    <p>I love to do many things on my freetime such as: wrestling, running, and playing video games.</p>
    <p>To begin with, wrestling is my favorite hobby, due to the fact that I have been apart of the sport since I could walk. I wrestled throughout elementary school, and started varcity while i was in eigth grade. I have taken third place for three consecutive years at my secion tournament, and I won all conferance my senior year. I was requruted to wrestle at Luther College in 2015-2016, and I am very excited and honored to be a part of this team.</p>
    <p>my second favorite hobby has to be running. I believe that running helps the mind wander. Throughout high school I was a part of the varsity track team in which I ran the 4x800m relay, the open 800m run, and the 400m run. I am planning to join the Luther College track team in the spring of 2016. </p>
    <p>My third favorite hobby has to be playing video games. Throughout my life I have played video games for many reasons. firstly I played them to relieve stress. growing up as a wrestler there is a lot of stress that builds while you are training and cutting weight, so to keep my mind off food I played video games. secondly, I use video games as an escape, so I don't have to deal with the world at that moment and become emerged as someone else in a different world, so I can accomplish different tasks i would never be able to do here.</p>
    <p>Hobbies are a great way to keep myself happy and preoccupied with my time and out of trouble.</p>
