<p>My name is Cameryn Cole Daniel Stadler. I graduated from Hayfield High School with the class of 2015.<br>
I am now a freshman at Luther College, and am majoring in Computer Science and Mathmatics with a minor in Art.<br>
I am a two sport athlete in which I wrestle in the winter and run track and field in the spring.<br>
When I have finished college I plan on going into the gaming industry with the hopes of programming or designing video games.
